To begin my final I used github pages to make a website using the instructioons provided at the bottom of this part of the class repo https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25/tree/main/07HTML%26CSS
Once i had the website up and running, I used claude to make me portfolio website template
!![Claude](../../../../Desktop/claude.jpg)
I then went through the template and changed the name to mine as well as added my bio skills and projects and fake contact info
I then found the video and images i was going to use and placed their names in the html files (ex gtr1.jpg) then made a /images and /videos folder in the repo to upload the media and have visible on the website
I had issues with the premade links for the contacts so I had a friend who majors in computer science help me by adding the "mailto:isaacsarosi@gmail.com" as well as "tel:+1234567890" lines so it could be clicked and used to contact me
